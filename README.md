About the App
Resturante locator is a website created to help Geospatial Technology student to locate a suitable restaurant near the campus. It allows users to filter by certain pefernces and also allows users to comment on their experience in a restaurant they visited. Users also have an additional feature where they can use the website to get directions to a chosen restaurant. Restaurants close to Nova Information Management School (NOVA IMS), Lisbon and University of Münster (UM), Institute for Geoinformatics (IFGI), Munster were considered for the app since these will be the two campuses that students will be on during their program.

Functionality of the Website.
The entire process of the website can be divided into three many components namely:
1. Extract, Transform and Load.
2. Utilizing APIs with the Django framework to make and receive API calls
3. Create, Read, Update and Delete.
4. Docker


#1. Extract, Transform and Load
Google Places API was used to retrieve resturants within a distance of 1000 meters  from both NOVA IMS and igfi schools. The API call returned a json with restaurants that met this requirements alongside the various information about them such as the type of food they sell.The data was then stored into an excel sheet in order to understand the data properly. A code was then implemented to extract the information from the excel sheet automatically. The data was cleaned (TRANSFORM) and the refined data was then loaded in a database created with postgres(LOAD).

#2 Utilizing APIS with the Django framework to make and receive API calls
In order to prevent users  from editing information directly from the database, APIs was used as an intermediary between the user and the database. The Django framework was utilized in achieving this. API calls were made when the user navigated from one page to another as well as when they made, edited and deleted comments. This improved the security of the database and prevented the database from being infiltrated.

#3 Create Read Update and Delete
A comment section was created under each restaurant. Users can CREATE comments, READ other users comments, UPDATE their comments by making edits to it as well as DELETE their comments.

#4 The various parts of the website was put in a docker container which was used to fetch various parts of the websites.


# Additional Functions
Open Streets Map and Leaflet Js was used to create a map where users could navigate from their current location to a selected restaurant. The user has the option of getting directions to a selcted restaurant. The is created on the map and the route gets updated as the user moves. The routing guides the user on the path to take untill he finally gets to his destination

# How the website runs
# Django Model
This project leverages Django, a high-level Python web framework, in conjunction with PostgreSQL as the backend database engine. Django follows the Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture, where:

Model (M): Handles interactions with the database and manages data.It is a blueprint that    
           defines how the data should be ornaginzed and stored in the database.
View (V): Implements business logic, communicates with models to fetch data, and renders       
           templates.The View receives HTTP requests from clients, such as web browsers or 
           mobile apps, and processes them according to the application's requirements. It                 retrieves necessary data from the Model layer, applies any necessary transformations 
          or computations, and selects the appropriate response to be returned to the client.

Template (T): Acts as the presentation layer, responsible for managing the User Interface    
             components of the application.This is where the html and css files are stored.



#  Project Structure
The project is organized into several components:

Restaurant_app: This serves as the primary app and encompasses settings, URL configurations, as well as WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) and ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) setups.

Accounts, pages, and restaurants apps: These are additional apps that fulfill specific functionalities.

Front-end folders: Other directories mainly cater to front-end aspects.

The main folder has other sub folders.

- Restaurant_app folder
The main website folder is called 'restaurant_app'. This folder contains the configurations for the projects. In the settings.py, the django configurations needed for the websites such as the base directory, the folder where the static html files will be placed and much more can be found here.
- urls.py
  This is responsible for running the urls. when the user accesses a certain url, the functions in this python file redirects the request to another python script depending on the url that is being accessed. If the script that the user is being directed to is another url.py, then that code will also redirect the user to another script untill it's finally redirected to a script that will render and html page which will be displayed on the website.

- Restaurants folder

* Migrations
This folder has scripts that creates tables in the postgres database. when this script is run, the tables and columns in the script will be created in the postgres.'python manage.py makemigrations' and then 'python manage.py migrate' commands are used to create the table.

* Urls.py
This script redirects the user to a python script or python function in a script based on the url request that is being made.

*  admin.py
Django creates an inbuilt administator page where the administator of the websites can edit infomation from that page. The admin needs to login with his credenials and he will be able to manage information from this page. The admin.py in this folder and other folders is responsible for adding additional information on the admin page.

* apps.py
This was created by default by django

* forms.py
This python file has the comment form that is rendered when the user needs to make a comment on a restaurant.

*choices.py
It has the choices the user has to select on various part of the website.

- Static Folder
This contains the html and css files that are used on the website.

-Templates
Contains part of the html and css files that are used on the website

- Media Folder
When the admin adds a picture to a restaurant or edit a restaurant's picture, the picture he uploads is stored here.

- Accounts
These accounts handles the registeration, logging in and loggin out of users.

-Pages Folder
This contains the views.py which has functions that displays restaurants on the home page and also has function for searching and filtering results. It also has a url.py which is responsible for redirecting of urls. The other python files are django configurations.




# Utilities
The manage.py script is a command-line utility that streamlines interaction with the Django project, allowing for tasks such as database migrations and server management.

# How to run the website
1. Python Packages Used
In order to run the website from the code, make sure you have these python packages installed:
- Django 5.0.1
- psycopg2 2.9.9
- pillow 10.2.0
- googlemaps 4.10.0
- requests 2.31.0

  2. Ensure that you have the proper database configuration as specified in the 'settings.py' file under the 'restaurant_app' module. 
  
  3. Migration Generation
  run the code 'python manage.py makemigrations' and then 'python manage.py migrate' in the terminal.This will create the necessary tables in postgres. Ensure that your current directory is the main folder.

 4. ETL Execution (Extract, Transform, Load)
    In order to retrieve the information from the google maps API onto the postgres database, you need to run the command 'python manage.py load restaurants'

 5. Launching the Server
 To run the websites, you need to run the command 'python manage.py runserver'
