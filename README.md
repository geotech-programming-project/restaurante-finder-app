About the App
Resturante locator is a website created to help Geospatial Technology student to locate a suitable restaurant near the campus. It allows users to filter by certain pefernces and also allows users to comment on their experience in a restaurant they visited. Users also have an additional feature where they can use the website to get directions to a chosen restaurant. Restaurants close to Nova Information Management School (NOVA IMS), Lisbon and University of MÃ¼nster (UM), Institute for Geoinformatics (IFGI), Munster were considered for the app since these will be the two campuses that students will be on during their program.

Functionality of the Website.
The entire process of the website can be divided into three many components namely:
1. Extract, Transform and Load.
2. Utilizing APIs with the Django framework to make and receive API calls
3. Create, Read, Update and Delete.
4. Docker


#1. Extract, Transform and Load
Google Places API was used to retrieve resturants within a distance of 1000 meters  from both NOVA IMS and igfi schools. The API call returned a json with restaurants that met this requirements alongside the various information about them such as the type of food they sell.The data was then stored into an excel sheet in order to understand the data properly. A code was then implemented to extract the information from the excel sheet automatically. The data was cleaned (TRANSFORM) and the refined data was then loaded in a database created with postgres(LOAD). ## Sirak- talk about the various column names that were created in the database ##.

#2 Utilizing APIS with the Django framework to make and receive API calls
In order to prevent users  from editing information directly from the database, APIs was used as an intermediary between the user and the database. The Django framework was utilized in achieving this. API calls were made when the user navigated from one page to another as well as when they made, edited and deleted comments. This improved the security of the database and prevented the database from being infiltrated.

#3 Create Read Update and Delete
A comment section was created under each restaurant. Users can CREATE comments, READ other users comments, UPDATE their comments by making edits to it as well as DELETE their comments.

#4 The various parts of the website was put in a docker container which was used to fetch various parts of the websites.


# Additional Functions
